<h1>Music</h1>

<p> When I was a kid I used to sing everywhere I went. There are even home videos of me "playing" the guitar and banging on the piano when I was in diapers. The first instrument I learned to play and formal training of music I had was learning the piano when I was four years old. </p>

<p>This is similar to the upright piano I have at my home and was also the piano I learned to play on. <p/>

<p>In the fourth grade I joined the school band. I learned to play the saxophone and got really interested in Jazz and improvisation. <p/>

<p>Around this time I also started teaching myself guitar. I come from a musical family where my parents, aunts, uncles, and cousins all played different musical instruments. Ranging from the piano, guitar, violin, saxophone, drums, cello, flutes, and others. My uncle was a professional jazz player from San Fransico and when he had gigs in New York he always spent a few nights in Connecticut. It was great to learn how to play guitar on my own and from watching my favorite artists play on youtube, but learning from my uncle was the best. <p/>

<p>The guitar below was the guitar my uncle always brought to Connecticut and the one that I was really obessing with having one day. Long story short, one year for my birthday he surprised me by giving me his guitar that I had been so fond of for years<p/>
